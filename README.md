# Computer Use Agent

## Overview
The Computer Use Agent is an intelligent system designed to interact with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using vision-based techniques. It parses screenshots, detects actionable elements, and enables automated or AI-driven control of computers. This project demonstrates how modern AI models can be used to understand and operate computer interfaces, making it possible to automate tasks, assist users, or build advanced agents for research and practical applications.

## Features
- Vision-based GUI parsing
- Action detection and grounding
- Integration with large language models (LLMs)
- Support for multiple agent architectures
- Extensible for custom workflows

## Project Structure
- `computer_agent.py`: Main agent logic for GUI interaction
- `computer_agent_graph.png`: Visual representation of the agent's architecture and workflow
- `demo.ipynb`: Example notebook demonstrating agent capabilities
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `util/`: Utility modules for parsing, annotation, and more
- `imgs/`: Images and icons used in the project
